# UGE
Untitled Game Engine | A 2D custom game engine developed in Python, customisable with an editor.

# Why should I use UGE over Unity or GameMaker?
UGE is completely open-source and free to work with as well as providing a simplified no-code environment. Multiplayer networking is also streamlined into the engine for easy peer-to-peer experiences.
